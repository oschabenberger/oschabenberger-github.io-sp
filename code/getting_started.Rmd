# Getting Started {#sec-getting-started}

## Getting Started with R {#sec-getting-started-R}

To work with `R` in this course, you need to be able to run `R` code, mix it
with prose and formulas in a notebook-style environment, and turn program and
output into pdf and html files. To accomplish this you will need

-   **`R`**. Download from [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

-   **RStudio**. Download RStudio Desktop from
    [Posit](https://posit.co/downloads/)

-   **LaTex**. [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) is a small distribution
    based on Tex Live that works well with `R` and can be manipulated through
    the `tinytex` `R` package.

You can skip `R` and RStudio installs if you do the work in a [Posit
Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) account. These are available for free
[here](https://posit.cloud/plans/free).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get started with `R` as a statistical programming language you need access to
`R` itself and a development environment from which to submit `R` code.

Download `R` for your operating system from the
[CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/) site. CRAN is the "Comprehensive R Archive
Network" and also serves as the package management system to add new packages to
your installation.

If you use VS Code as a development environment, add the "R Extension for Visual
Studio" to your environment. We are focusing on RStudio as a development
environment here.

### Posit Cloud

In today's cloud world, you can get both through [Posit
Cloud](https://posit.cloud/). Posit is the company behind RStudio, Quarto, and
other cool tools. Their cloud offering gives you access to an RStudio instance
in the cloud. You can sign up for a free account
[here](https://posit.cloud/plans/free). The only drawback of the free account is
its limitations in terms of RAM, CPU, execution time, etc. For the work you will
be doing in this course, and probably many other courses, you will not exceed
the limitations of the free account.

Once you have created an account, the workspace is organized the same way as a
RStudio session on your desktop.

### R and RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for `R`, but supports
other languages as well. For example, using Quarto in RStudio, you can mix `R`,
Python, and other code within the same document. Download Rstudio Desktop
[here](https://posit.co/downloads/).

The RStudio IDE is organized in panes, each pane can have multiple tabs
(@fig-rstudio-ide). The important panes are

-   **Source**. The files you edit. These can be R files (.R), Rmarkdown (.Rmd),
    Quarto (.qmd), or any other text files.

-   **Console**. Here you can enter `R` commands directly at the command prompt
    "\>". This pane also has a `Terminal` tab for an OS terminal and a
    `Background Jobs` tab. The latter is important when you knit documents into
    pdf or html format.

-   **Environment**. Displays information about the objects created in the `R`
    session. You can click on an object for a more detailed look at it in the
    `Viewer`.

-   **Help**. This pane contains many useful tabs, such as a File browse,
    package information, access to the documentation and help system. Plots
    generated from the `Console` or from an `R` script are displayed in the
    `Plots` tab of this pane.

### Package Management

The `R` installation comes with attached base packages, you do not need to
install or load those. Any other packages are enabled in a two-step process:

1.  Install the package
2.  Load the package in your `R` session with the `library()` command.

Installing the package is done once, this step adds the package to your system.
Loading the library associated with the package needs to be done in every `R`
session. Without loading the library, `R` cannot find the functions exported by
the library.

#### Installing standard packages

A **standard** `R` package is made available through the
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (Comprehensive R Archive Network)
repositories. To install package "foo" from CRAN use

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("harmony")
```

To install multiple packages, specify them as a character vector:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("foo","bar","foobar"))
```

To uninstall (remove) one or more packages from a system, use the

```{r eval=FALSE}
remove.packages(c("foo","bar"))
```

command.

Packages are installed by default into the directory given as the first element
of the `.libPaths()` function. On my Mac this is

```{r}
.libPaths()[1]
```

If you wish to install a package in a different location, provide the location
in the `lib=""` argument of `install.packages()`. Note that if you use a
non-default location for the package install you need to specify that location
when you load the library with the `library` command.

To make the functionality in a package available to your `R` session, use the
library command. For example, the following statements make the `dplyr` and
`Rfast` functions available.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library("dplyr")
library("Rfast")
```

Libraries export functions into the `R` name space and sometimes these can
collide. For example, the `Rfast` package exports functions `knn` and `knn.cv`
for $k$-nearest neighbor and cross-validated $k$-nearest neighbor analysis.
Functions by the same name also exist in the `class` package. To make it
explicit which function to use, prepend the function name with the package name:

```{r eval=FALSE}
Rfast::knn()

class::knn.cv()
```

To load a library from a non-standard location, for example, when you installed
the package in a special directory by using `lib=` on `install.packages()`, you
need to specify the `lib.loc=""` option in the `library` command.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("some_package_name", lib="/custom_path/to/packages/")

library("some_package_name", lib.loc="/custom_path/to/packages/")
```

All available packages in your `R` environment can be seen with the

```{r eval=FALSE}
library() 
```

command.

Libraries have dependencies and if you want to install all libraries that a
given one depends on, choose `dependencies=TRUE` in the `install.packages()`
call:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("randomForest", dependencies=TRUE)
```

#### Installing non-standard packages

A package that is not served by the CRAN repository cannot be installed with
`install.packages()`. The need for this might arise when you want to install a
developer-modified version of a package before it lands on CRAN. This can be
accomplished with the `devtools` package. The following statements install
"some_package" from GitHub.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("some_package")
```

Once a non-standard package is installed you load it into a session in the same
way as a standard package, with the `library` command.

You can see all packages installed on your system with

```{r eval=FALSE}
as.vector(installed.packages()[,"Package"])
```

and the packages loaded into your workspace with

```{r}
(.packages())
```

A more detailed breakdown of the packages in groups, along with other
information about the session, is available from `sessionInfo()`.

As you write more `R` code and add packages to your system, you will ask
yourself "Did I not install that previously?" The following code snippet helps
to install only those packages from a list that are not already installed.

```{r}
libs_to_load <- c("dplyr", "readr", "magrittr","reshape2","ggplot2")
libs_to_install <- libs_to_load[!libs_to_load %in% installed.packages()]
for (lib in libs_to_install) install.packages(lib, dependencies=TRUE)
sapply(libs_to_load, library, character=TRUE)
```

#### Unloading a library

The easiest way to unload the libraries you loaded in an `R` session is to
restart the session. :)

To unload a library from an `R` session you can use the `detach` function with
the `unload=TRUE` option. For example, to remove the `randomForest` library
without restarting the session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
detach("package:randomForest",unload=TRUE)
```

### Session Information

It is a good practice to add at the end of `R` programs a listing of the
environment in which the program executed. This will show others what packages
were loaded and their version. If you use the `RNG=TRUE` option, the random
number generators are also reported, more on this in @sec-random.

For this session, the info is as follows:

```{r}
sinfo <- sessionInfo()
print(sinfo,RNG=T)
```

You can drill down into the details of the information, for example,

```{r}
sinfo$loadedOnly$rmarkdown
```
