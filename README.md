# Statistical Programming

This is introductory material about statistical programming, focused primarily on R.

Welcome to this short treatise about statistical programming and statistical program packages.
This is online material in a series of collections used in teaching data science and statistics at the graduate level. 
This material on statistical programming accompanies

- [Foundations of Data Science--Beyond the Numbers](https://oschabenberger.github.io/oschabenberger-github.io-bn/) (*Foundations*) and

- [Statistical Learning](https://oschabenberger.github.io/oschabenberger-github.io-sl/) (*StatLearning*).

*Foundations* covers fundamental concepts in data science and the data science project life cycle. 
*StatLearning* is a comprehensive collection of modules on supervised and unsupervised learning from a statistical perspective.

All three "books" were written in Quarto because it combines prose with math and supports multiple programming languages and kernels within the same framework. To learn more about Quarto books visit <https://quarto.org/docs/books>.
